# Word Pronunciator
What if we spoke English the way it was spelled? Talk to Word Pronunciator to find out what it would sound like!

[Run it (tested on Google Chrome for Mac, doesn't work on Safari or mobile devices)](https://akashlevy.github.io/WordPronunciator/)

### Popular examples:
* "the four birds went on a night flight"
* "what are you doing"
* "what is in the fridge"

### How it works:
* Coded in HTML5
* Processes input using browser's speech recognition
* Converts script to Devanagari (a phonetic alphabet) based on a set of rules
* Outputs pronunciated speech using Google's Devanagari synthesizer
